      <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6">
        We’re three entrepreneurs brought together by a shared frustration: finding the perfect holiday that works for everyone. Too often we’ve sat on the beach thinking “this could have been planned better.” We believe no one should have to feel that way.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6">
        That’s why we set out on our first adventure together—not to chase the sun, but to build Plan My Holiday.AI: a world-class platform that takes the stress out of holiday planning.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8">Our mission is simple:</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6">
        <li>Help families, couples, and solo travellers discover trips they’ll love.</li>
        <li>Use AI to personalise recommendations for flights, hotels, and activities.</li>
        <li>Create a tool we’d proudly use ourselves.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-800">
        At the heart of it, we’re building the platform we always wished existed. Because planning your holiday should be as exciting as living it.
